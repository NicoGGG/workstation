# My workstation config

(inspired by [TechDufus .dotfiles](https://github.com/techdufus/dotfiles) repo)

## Install with ansible

First create the vault password file in ~/.ansible-vault/vault.secret.
Then run this command (curl needs to be installed)

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NicoGGG/workstation/main/workstation.sh)"
```
